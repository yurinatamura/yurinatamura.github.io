            <p> I coordinated a strategic 2-week recruitment timeline, planning over 5 networking events that yielded more than 100 qualified candidates.

                I networked with over 50 professors and alumni from various fields related to the 14+ programs offered at UCI, fostering valuable connections and opportunities for students. Each quarter, I organized 3 events aimed at encouraging students to explore diverse professional industries, which resulted in increased student engagement and career exploration. Additionally, I collaborated with academic departments and student organizations to ensure a wide range of perspectives and experiences were represented, enhancing the overall impact of these events.</p>
